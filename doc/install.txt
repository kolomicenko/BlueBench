For the installation of BlueBench and its successful execution, at least these steps must be performed:

1) necessary JRE 1.7 and ant
2) installation of all standalone DB engines (MongoDB, MySQL, InfiniteGraph). The engines must be running.
3) the input graph files must be generated and placed in the appropriate folder (data/datasets/)
4) finally running run.sh for the compilation and execution of BlueBench (abort.sh for aborting the execution)
5) progress of the execution is output in the 'log' file. Benchmark results are in data/results
